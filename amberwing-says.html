        <p>
            We&rsquo;re swimming in PE for the entire month. <em>Normally</em>, I wouldn&rsquo;t be upset over swimming,
            but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I really <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to swim during PE.
        </p>
        <p>And then I have a test in both biology and math.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m so tired. I have no energy to take tests.</p>
        <p>Why do we need to take a test <em>now</em>? WHYyy?!</p>

        <h3>16 September 2021</h3>
        <p>I&rsquo;m now writing about the theme of the short story The Veldt. (Language Arts)</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a good story. You should <a target="blank"
                href="https://repositorio.ufsc.br/bitstream/handle/123456789/163728/The%20Veldt%20-%20Ray%20Bradbury.pdf">read</a> it.</p>
        <p>
            The story is about a family that bought a &ldquo;HappyLife home.&rdquo; The house does whatever they need for them. The family overrelies on their house. There are two problems with this.
        </p>
        <p>The first problem is the fact that they have nothing to do all day because the house does everything for them!</p>
        <p>
            The second problem is their children don&rsquo;t listen to them anymore. This is because of the nursery in the house. They view the nursery as their own parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            George tried to turn off the nursery because they are always in the African veldt in the nursery, so Peter and Wendy were not happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peter wanted to kill his parents. He and his sister (Wendy) locked them in the nursery with the lions. George and Lidiya were eaten by the veldt lions.

        <p>PE. Swimming. <em>Sidestroke</em>. Help. Why do we need to learn <em>sidestroke</em>?! What&rsquo;s the use? It&rsquo;s so hard!!</p>
        <p>Feet like scissors, as for hands&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&rsquo;t even know how to explain.</p>
        <p><em>Help!!</em></p>
        <p>I do have some good news though: I got a 90.24% on my math test. Previously I got a score around 70%. So I hope this 90 pulls my grade up a bit.</p>
        <p>I also got a 90% on my biology test.</p>
